## What is iubenda?

__iubenda is a privacy policy generation framework that helps app developers, website owners and anyone else with creating a privacy notice. The privacy notice can be generated in 6 languages (English, Italian, German, Spanish, French and now, Brazilian Portuguese).__

The privacy policy can 

- generate a quick _link and will be hosted on iubenda's servers_
- be _embedded_ into a website or mobile app view
- automatically be _updated from the iubenda dashboard_
- automatically be __updated by iubenda__ when there are legal changes
- copied into additional languages with no work whatsoever from the user's part


## How is it immediately useful for Brazilians?

- __For website owners and especially mobile app creators who want to target an international crowd__

iubenda's privacy policy is based on European and partly US based privacy regulations. The privacy policy can be easily and quickly added to the app store.

- __Facebook app makers__

Facebook requires privacy policies for their apps.

- __Website owners and app makers__

The iubenda framework could help to craft a privacy policy in Brazilian Portuguese for the domestic market.


## Additional blogger offer

    Brazilian tech bloggers can try iubenda & can use the policy for an entire year if they want.

    We are also happy to give your readers an additional first-year free account.
